# Clear-Temporary-Files
### Use this batch (cmd) file to clear all your temporary files (temp, %temp%, prefetch), run disk cleanup, and defragment the drive in one click, making your computer fast
To use it, download the 'clear-temp-files.bat' file on your desktop or any other folder you wish, double click it, and click 'Yes' on the popup which appears saying 'Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?'. This permission is required to run the defragmentation and clear Recycle bin.

Then, the process would start running in an open command window, and would first clear all the Temp files, then it would run the disk defragmentation, and then a popup for disk clean up would open... Select all options in the popup and click 'OK".

Congratulations! The computer speed is now boosted!
You may save the file in the username directory so that u can run it using WIN+R, and u can create a shortcut to it to the desktop.
